# pronoun-picker
A short AngelScript function to be attached to a menu to let the player pick their preferred pronouns in Novelty.

# Future Features:
- Grammar adjustments for they/them pronoun sets and similar.
- Context sensitive capitalization (i.e. if it's the first word in the sentence)
- More neopronoun options built-in. As-is, they are easy to add by copy-pasting existing statements, but there are plans to add more.

# To Use:
Reat the comments in the code- they explain how to use the variables that the code sets up in order to get the desired output in dialog.
