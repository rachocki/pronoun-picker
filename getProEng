// How to use: Create a menu with the pronouns in desired order. 
// Ints are assigned to each set, and are returned by the menu. Call function after player pronoun int is set.
// In dialog where the pronoun is needed, insert [$pNUM] where necessary. (ex. "she is going to the airport" would be 
// implemented as "[$p1] is going to the airport". 

//Future Features:
//- Grammar adjustments for they/them pronoun sets and similar.
//- Context sensitive capitalization (i.e. if it's the first word in the sentence)
//- More neopronoun options built in. As-is, they are easy to add by copy-pasting existing structures, but there are
//  plans to add more.
